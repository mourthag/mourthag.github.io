<a name="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome</h3>

<p>Welcome to my Homepage. My name is Julian and I'm a software developer who recently graduated with a Master's degree from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). My main topic of interest is image synthesis and GPGPU in which I specialized at KIT through various labs, seminars and thesis'. I also gathered some practical experience with deep learning and computer vision at KIT. </p>

<a name="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>

Here is a selected List of some of my projects:
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mourthag.github.io/unity-path-tracer.html" class="octicon octicon-link" style="font-size:large;">Unity Path Tracer</a> <br> 
      A real-time path tracer implemented in compute shaders for Unity with Next Event Estimation, Disney BSDF and BVH generation. <br><br> </li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/mourthag/RaidPlanner" class="octicon octicon-link" style="font-size:large;">Discord Raid Planner</a> <br> 
    A discord bot that helps scheduling raids with friends. Mainly used for Destiny 2 due to the default activities available. <br><br> </li>

  <li> <b style="font-size:large;font-weight: bold;">Non-Overlapped Tiling for Spatiotemporal Variance-Guided Filtering</b> <br> 
    This project was the topic of my masters thesis. 
    I optimized <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2017-07_spatiotemporal-variance-guided-filtering-real-time-reconstruction-path-traced">SVGF</a>, a real-time denoising filter for path traced images, by implementing a new scheduling method for its iterative spatial filter. 
    The rescheduling was based on polyhedral optimization, i.e. Split Tiling, and achieved a speedup of factor two, halving the overall runtime. <br><br> </li>

  <li> <b style="font-size:large;font-weight: bold;">Fast Volumetric Obscurance with Moment-based Reconstructions</b> <br> 
    This project was the topic of my bachelors thesis. I implemented a new screen-space approach for volumetric obscurance, the general version of ambient occlusion, that uses several moments of the depth buffer combined with a spatial blur. 
    The results were promising but still featured several artifacts and the runtime was limited due to the expensive spatial blur.<br><br> </li>  
</ul>
